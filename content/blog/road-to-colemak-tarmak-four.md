Another month has passed, and it is time to move to the next step in the Colemak journey.

My current [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) results for [Tarmak layout three](https://dreymar.colemak.org/tarmak.html): tested with 10, 25, and 50 words and got a WMP of 44.35, 39.78, and 44.15, respectively, with over 92.9% accuracy. Still consistent, but accuracy has reduced by 2%.

It took me a bit longer to get used to Tarmak three compared to previous iterations. Tarmak four will likely have a similar impact:

The fourth layout changes the ` J>Y>O>;>P` keys, finally bringing the `J` key into its final placing. The `O` key is placed in the home row, with the `Y` key taking its previous position. The `P` key moves to the opposite side, and the `;` key moves one row up.

It will take some time to get used to these changes, but I'm looking forward to reaching the next final step, hopefully in a month.
