A few years ago, I was convinced by a friend to get a NAS. They showed me how
they used it to store his music library and their photos and back up their
computers. I don’t do photography, but having my local music library on a server
that I could access from any of my devices was very intriguing. And as a bonus,
I’d have a backup server for all my computers.

Turns out, these things ain’t cheap. I ended up buying it, initially, with only
two disks to limit my costs. After playing with it, I started to see all the
possibilities and things I could do with this new toy. There are so many
open-source tools that you can self-host.

Need something to track your finances? Self-host it. Media center? Self-host it.
E-mail? It may be possible; I wish you good luck! Jokes apart, I’ve moved many
of the online services I used, most of them paid, to a self-hosted one. With a
little bit of effort, it is not only possible to reduce costs but increase your
privacy. You own your data, and that’s something I value a lot.

Here is a list of the things I’m currently self-hosting, and I hope to expand
this list soon. I plan to write a post with more details for some of these.

- [Firefly III][firefly], to keep track of my expenses. In the past I've used
[YNAB][ynab], and although Firefly III does not follow the same philosophy, it
took little time to adjust.
- [Miniflux][miniflux] as my feed reader.
- [Linkding][linkding] replaces [Pinboard][pinboard] as my bookmark manager.
- I use [Plex][plex] as my media server. Granted it is a paid service, but you
can self-host it, and the [Plexamp][pleramp] is neat.
- [Taiga][taiga] is a pretty cool product management tool that I use for my
personal projects, and it makes me dislike Jira even more.
- And from the same folks that make Taiga, there's [Penpot][penpot], which
replaced [Sketch][sketch].

Other tools that are worth mentioning are [LanguageTool][languagetool],
[wger][wger], [Resilio Sync Home][resilio], [Learning With Texts][lwt] and
[ollama-webui][ollama-webui].

There's a lot more I want self-host; here are a few things from the top of my
head: blog, books (epub), password manager, SCM (Git, Fossil, etc.), music 
scrobbler, analytics tool, and so on. If I got you curious, check the 
[Awesome-Selfhosted][awesome-selfhosted] list to find the right tool for you.
